Note to Instructor

Features We Didn't Implement:
We did not meet the goal of having a live stream sidebar of videos on 
our website, because we could not find a suitable API for integration of
videos. 

Besides that, all the features work, including the additional game pages
and the game event feed. Users are also able to follow events and receive live updates
from any game pages/events they are subscribed to. 

Please let any one of us know if you have any questions when using the site! Thanks!
